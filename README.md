Welcome,

The initiative “#dataforbetterhealth” aims to identify the existing impediments for a FAIR data policy in public health and to formulate, test and implement solutions for these impediments  in order to achieve an integrated data access policy. These solutions must be technically, semantically, economically and legally sustainable. In addition, a widely supported governance model needs to be elaborated.
The initiative #dataforbetterhealth brings business, technology, and medical professionals together to solve problems within the medical industry by combining the knowledge base of different specialties in an innovative environment.
In this hackathon, an anonymised version of the database “DOC PH” is provided by the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI/RIZIV/INAMI). This dataset contains information about medication delivery in all Belgian hospitals, since 2002.
