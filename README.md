# introduction
The initiative “#dataforbetterhealth” aims to identify the existing impediments for a FAIR data policy in public health and to formulate, test and implement solutions for these impediments  in order to achieve an integrated data access policy. These solutions must be technically, semantically, economically and legally sustainable. In addition, a widely supported governance model needs to be elaborated.
The initiative #dataforbetterhealth brings business, technology, and medical professionals together to solve problems within the medical industry by combining the knowledge base of different specialties in an innovative environment.

It can be expected that an integrated data access policy will lead to better support for scientific research, a more effective development of medicines and medical devices, improved of patient care, improved and support for clinical trials, support for personalized care, support for prevention, patient centered care, and lower medical expenses…
